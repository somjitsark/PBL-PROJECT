This is our FSD project "Cricket Score Management System" 
Cricket Score Management System is a comprehensive web application built with Django
that streamlines the process of managing cricket matches.
The system allows users to create and manage teams,
record ball-by-ball data for players and teams through the admin panel, 
and dynamically display detailed player statistics and match analytics.
It features interactive visualizations such as score progression graphs, 
player performance charts, 
and predictive analytics including score prediction and win probability. 
The application is designed with an intuitive and responsive UI to enhance the user experience, 
making it an ideal solution for organizing and analyzing cricket matches at various levels.
